## 1.1 Introduction to Apache Hive

### What is Hive?
Apache Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop for providing data summarization, query, and analysis. It enables users to write queries in a SQL-like language (HiveQL) which are then converted into MapReduce or Tez or Spark jobs for execution on Hadoop.

### Key Features of Hive:
- **SQL-Like Language (HiveQL)**: Supports querying large datasets using a familiar query syntax.
- **Scalability**: Built to scale across distributed storage like HDFS.
- **Schema on Read**: Allows flexibility in handling unstructured data by applying schema when reading data.
- **Extensibility**: Support for custom UDFs (User Defined Functions).
- **ACID Compliance**: Hive supports ACID transactions for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.
- **Partitioning & Bucketing**: Allows data optimization and query performance enhancement.

### Use Cases:
- **Data Warehousing**: Hive is widely used for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations and data analysis over large datasets.
- **Batch Processing**: Processing large-scale datasets where performance and scalability are key.
- **Business Analytics**: Hive is often used in conjunction with BI tools for generating reports and business insights.

## 1.2 Hive Architecture

### Overview of Hive Architecture:
Hive architecture consists of a user interface, a metadata store, a compiler, an execution engine, and Hadoop components for processing. It converts HiveQL queries into jobs that run on Hadoop’s distributed environment using MapReduce, Tez, or Spark engines.

### Hive Components:
- **User Interface (CLI, Web UI, JDBC/ODBC)**: Users interact with Hive using a command-line interface, Web UI, or JDBC/ODBC drivers to submit queries.
- **Hive Compiler (Parser, Optimizer, Execution Plan)**: The compiler parses the query, generates an execution plan, and optimizes the query for efficient execution.
- **Execution Engine (MapReduce, Tez, Spark)**: The execution engine processes the query and returns results. Depending on the configuration, it can run on MapReduce, Tez, or Spark.
- **Metastore**: A relational database that stores metadata about the tables, columns, partitions, and schema information. It plays a crucial role in query planning and optimization.

## 1.3 Hive Data Models

### Databases, Tables, Partitions, and Buckets:
- **Databases**: Logical namespaces that organize tables.
- **Tables**: Structured data organized into rows and columns.
- **Partitions**: A way to divide tables into smaller segments based on a column (e.g., date), improving query performance.
- **Buckets**: Data is further subdivided within partitions based on a hashing function, providing better sampling and query optimization.

### Managed vs External Tables:
- **Managed Table**: Hive manages the lifecycle of the data, including deletion.
- **External Table**: Hive only manages the schema; the data's lifecycle is managed externally, leaving it untouched upon table deletion.

### Views, Indexes, and Materialized Views:
- **Views**: Logical tables created based on existing tables' queries. Data is not physically stored.
- **Indexes**: Improve query performance by creating indexes on columns.
- **Materialized Views**: A view where the results are stored physically to enhance query performance.

### Storage Formats:
- **ORC (Optimized Row Columnar)**: Efficient for reading and writing large datasets.
- **Parquet**: Columnar storage format optimized for analytics.
- **Avro**: A row-based format that supports schema evolution.
- **SequenceFile**: Binary file format that stores serialized key-value pairs.
- **TextFile**: A human-readable format, but inefficient for large-scale processing.

## 1.4 Hive Query Language (HiveQL)

### Basic SQL Operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE):
- **SELECT**: Retrieves data from tables.
- **INSERT**: Inserts data into tables.
- **UPDATE**: Modifies existing data (available only in ACID-compliant tables).
- **DELETE**: Removes rows from tables (only for ACID-compliant tables).

### Aggregations and Grouping (GROUP BY, COUNT, SUM):
- Use **GROUP BY** to group rows by a specific column and apply aggregate functions like **COUNT()**, **SUM()**, **AVG()**, etc.

### Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER):
- **INNER JOIN**: Returns rows with matching values in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table, along with matching rows from the right.
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the right table, along with matching rows from the left.
- **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Combines the results of both left and right joins, filling in NULLs when no match is found.

### Subqueries:
- Queries nested inside another query to retrieve data for complex analysis.

### Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, LEAD, LAG):
- Provide analytics capabilities like ranking, row numbering, and accessing data across rows within a partition without aggregation.

## 1.5 Data Loading in Hive

### Loading Data from HDFS:
```sql
LOAD DATA INPATH '/path/to/hdfs/directory' INTO TABLE table_name;
```

### Loading Data from Local Files:
```sql
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/path/to/local/file' INTO TABLE table_name;
```

### External Tables for Data Import/Export:
Create external tables that reference data stored outside of Hive’s warehouse, allowing for easier import/export operations.

## 1.6 Partitioning and Bucketing

### Concept of Partitioning:
Partitioning divides a large table into smaller logical units based on the values of a specific column (e.g., date). This improves query performance by scanning only the relevant partitions.

### Dynamic vs Static Partitioning:
- **Static Partitioning**: Manually define partitions when inserting data.
- **Dynamic Partitioning**: Partitions are automatically created when data is inserted.

### Bucketing:
Divides data into smaller segments within partitions based on a hash function applied to a column, improving query sampling and joining.

## 1.7 Optimization Techniques

### Partition Pruning:
Optimizes queries by scanning only the required partitions based on query conditions.

### Predicate Pushdown:
Pushes down query filters to the storage layer, minimizing data transferred for processing.

### Vectorized Query Execution:
Improves query execution by processing a batch of rows at once, reducing CPU overhead.

### Cost-Based Optimizer (CBO):
The CBO uses table statistics to generate the most efficient query execution plan.

## 1.8 Hive Performance Tuning

### Parallel Execution:
Execute multiple MapReduce jobs in parallel to speed up query processing.

### Join Optimization (Map Join, SMB Join):
- **Map Join**: Small tables are loaded into memory for faster joins.
- **Sort-Merge Bucket (SMB) Join**: Optimizes joins for bucketed tables by sorting and merging data.

### Compression Techniques (Snappy, GZIP, LZO):
Apply compression to reduce storage size and speed up query execution.

## 1.9 Advanced Features

### ACID Transactions in Hive (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE):
Supports full ACID transactions, allowing users to perform **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE** operations while maintaining data integrity.

### UDFs, UDAFs, UDTFs (User-Defined Functions):
- **UDFs**: Functions for scalar values.
- **UDAFs**: Functions for aggregating data.
- **UDTFs**: Functions for returning multiple rows for a single input.

### Security and Authorization:
Hive integrates with security frameworks like Apache Ranger or Apache Sentry for role-based access control, along with Kerberos authentication.

## 1.10 Hive on Spark/Tez/LLAP

### Overview of Hive on Different Execution Engines (Tez, Spark):
Hive can execute queries on different engines like **Tez** (optimized for low-latency processing), **Spark** (for in-memory processing), and **LLAP** (Low-Latency Analytical Processing).

### Advantages of LLAP:
- Faster query execution by reducing latency.
- In-memory caching.
- Improved concurrency for BI-style queries.
